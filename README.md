# 🧑‍🎓 Student Management System (Java CRUD Application)

This is a console-based **Student Management System** developed in **Java**, designed to perform full **CRUD operations**—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—on student records. It demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as **encapsulation**, and uses **ArrayList** for dynamic data storage.

## ✨ Features

- ➕ Add new student records  
- 📋 View all student details  
- ✏️ Update existing student information  
- ❌ Delete student entries  
- 🧼 Clear and user-friendly console interface  

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation**: Student data is protected using private fields and accessed via public getters/setters.  
- **ArrayList**: Dynamic array structure used to store and manage student records efficiently.  
- **OOP Design**: Modular class structure separating data models and logic.  

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java (Core)
- ArrayList
- Object-Oriented Programming
